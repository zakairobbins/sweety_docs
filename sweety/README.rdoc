This is my version of Sweety, an application for recording a user's blood glucose levels and viewing data about them in different timeframes. Technologies I used in addition to the required ones are:

-FactoryGirl: The requirements stated that "In the future, doctors may also have access to this application to
review patient entered blood glucose levels." Given that, I thought factories would be much easier to maintain as the app scaled up. For example, if the database is updated to associate doctors with patients, it would require only two lines of code to reflect that in factories, whereas if fixtures were used, each one would have to be updated.

-Rack Session Access: in order to ease the process of creating and maintaining tests, I used this as a workaround for the user identity verification in the controllers.
